        ## 🪄 Thanks for suggesting an addition to the Icon Wizard!
        The [Icon Wizard](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/add-icons/icon-wizard) lets folks add modifiers to any existing Font Awesome Pro icon.

  - type: textarea
    id: modifier-description
    attributes:
      label: "🧙‍♂️ What modifier are you requesting?"
      description: "Describe the modifier you'd like to add and what it should represent. Pasting an image here works, too."

  - type: textarea
    id: modifier-usage
    attributes:
      label: "💡 How would you use this modifier?"
      description: "Tell us how you'd combine it with core icons and where it would show up in a UI.\n\nEx: `folder + file` for file-related folders, `user + warning` for risky accounts, etc."

  - type: checkboxes
    id: checklist
    attributes:
      label: "✅ Request checklist"
      options:
        - label: "This is a generic symbol, not a brand or logo"
          required: true
        - label: "This concept would work as a **small corner/badge modifier**, not a full-size icon"
          required: true
        - label: "I've checked existing Icon Wizard modifiers and didn't find this idea"
          required: true
        - label: "This is a single, clear modifier concept"
          required: true
